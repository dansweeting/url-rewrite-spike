Examples

A static file lives at:   /Scripts/_references.js

Using the configured url rewriting rules, 
any request with an arbitrary version number prefix, 
such as:  /v1.0.0.0/Scripts/_references.js

would be redirected to /Scripts/_reference.js

Rule would need to be tightened up... this rule is based on a really generic regex 
that would currently match on any top level folder prefixed with v!  


 The rules file lives in Rewrite.Web\ManagedFusion.Rewriter.txt
